            <h2>Area Director</h2>
                Hi, I'm Rachael Beaumont, the Area Director to Baker House! 
I was born and raised in Lawrence, KS where I got my undergraduate degree in Theater Education at the University of Kansas before moving to Lincoln, NE to get my Masters in Student Affairs! 
I've spent some time in the Midwest working before coming to MIT where I'm excited to share in the experiences and the traditions with every student here! 
I'm a regular at the gym so if you see me say hi! I love trying out new recipes, exploring the city, watching baking shows, and can never go wrong with a good board game! 
I hope you'll swing by for a chat or a cup of coffee!
            </p>

                <h2>GRAs</h2>
                A Graduate Resident Advisor (GRA) is a graduate student at MIT who lives in the undergraduate community and serves as mentor, advocate, and resource for the students. 
Baker has 10 GRAs including a Leadership GRA who helps with the Baker Leaders program. 
While the GRAs focus on their individual areas on floors, they are available to the whole community as a resource.
Meet our Baker GRAs!
