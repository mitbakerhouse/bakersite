                Hi, I'm Rachael Beaumont, the Area Director to Baker House! 
I was born and raised in Lawrence, KS where I got my undergraduate degree in Theater Education at the University of Kansas before moving to Lincoln, NE to get my Masters in Student Affairs! 
I've spent some time in the Midwest working before coming to MIT where I'm excited to share in the experiences and the traditions with every student here! 
I'm a regular at the gym so if you see me say hi! I love trying out new recipes, exploring the city, watching baking shows, and can never go wrong with a good board game! 
I hope you'll swing by for a chat or a cup of coffee!
